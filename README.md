# [The Open Vocabulary Level Test](https://osf.io/afcg2/)

The Open Vocabulary Level Test  (“OpenVLT”) is an open source vocabulary level test that produces an English level score based on the CEFR, an internationally recognized standard for English assesment, and that also correlates with TOEIC®,  TOEFL®, and IELTS® scores.

The OpenVLT allows teachers, e-learning solution providers and researchers to share an open source, royalty-free, widely-available vocabulary level test that can be easily implemented by schools, commercial CALL providers or researchers.

**OpenVLT Specification**: The spec for the OpenVLT is maintained here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/17IYOE4Ry2F7MJJ8ZxdyR-XjEddt_sqkRME0dQl3YryM/edit?usp=sharing
